<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spine Surgery Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion Products</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spine surgery products market consists of two primary types: spinal fusion products and non-fusion products. Spinal fusion products facilitate the joining of two or more vertebrae to provide stability, often using implants such as rods and screws. Non-fusion products, on the other hand, aim to alleviate pain and restore mobility without permanently joining spinal segments, including devices like artificial discs and motion-preserving systems. Both categories cater to diverse patient needs and surgical approaches in spinal care.</p></p>
