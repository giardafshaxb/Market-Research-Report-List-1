<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Inhaler Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inhalers</li><li>Nebulizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart inhaler technology encompasses devices designed to enhance the management of respiratory conditions. The market is primarily divided into two categories: inhalers and nebulizers. Inhalers, which deliver medication directly to the lungs, include metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), often integrated with sensors to track usage and provide reminders. Nebulizers, on the other hand, convert liquid medication into a mist, suitable for patients unable to use traditional inhalers. Both types aim to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes.</p></p>
