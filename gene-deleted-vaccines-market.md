<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene-Deleted Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Gene Deleted Vaccine</li><li>Double Gene Deleted Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene-deleted vaccines are engineered to enhance safety and efficacy by removing specific genes from pathogenic organisms. The single gene-deleted vaccine targets one essential gene, significantly reducing virulence while maintaining immunogenicity, making it safer for use in humans or animals. In contrast, double gene-deleted vaccines eliminate two genes, further attenuating the pathogen, which can result in broader and stronger immune responses. Both types are crucial in developing effective vaccines against various infectious diseases while minimizing the risk of reversion to virulence.</p></p>
